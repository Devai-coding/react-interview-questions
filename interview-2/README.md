# Interview 2 :

Create two dropdowns where the second dropdown dynamically updates based on the selection in the first dropdown.
You have an array of country objects, each containing a name, value, and an array of cities.

```sh
const countries = [
  { name: "India", value: "IN", cities: ["Delhi", "Mumbai"] },
  { name: "United States", value: "US", cities: ["New York", "Los Angeles"] },
  { name: "Japan", value: "JP", cities: ["Tokyo", "Osaka"] },
];
```

* Display the first dropdown with country names.
* Display the second dropdown with city names.
* The second dropdown should dynamically update based on the selected country in the first dropdown.
* Ensure that, after refreshing the page, the second dropdown displays cities associated with the initially selected country.
