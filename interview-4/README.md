# Interview 4 :

Build a React component that allows users to select hobbies and days interactively. The component includes two sets of radio buttonsâ€”one for hobbies (football, video games, basketball) and another for days (weekday, weekend). Users can choose one hobby and one day simultaneously. The selected combination dynamically generates a sentence displaying the chosen hobby and day, providing an engaging and user-friendly experience.
* The initial arrays :

```sh
const options = ["football", "video games", "bascketball"];
const days = ["weekday", "weekend"];
```

* Ensure that the sentence displaying the selected combination won't show unless both a hobby and a day are selected.
