# Interview 6 :
In this memory card game, players aim to match pairs of cards with identical values. The game initializes with a randomized layout of cards.
* For the card content just use numbers. Exemple this data :
```sh
const cardArray = ["1", "2", "3", "1", "2", "3"];
```
* the cards should display in a random way.

## How to Play:
* Click on a card to reveal its value.
* Click on another card to find a matching pair.
** If the pair matches, both cards stay face up.
** If the pair doesn't match, both cards are briefly displayed before being turned face down.
* Once two cards are matched or mismatched, other cards become unclickable to enhance gameplay clarity.
* Continue until all pairs are successfully matched.
